# Session Handoff

Capture what you learned THIS SESSION before context compaction. This is NOT for generating docs from PRD (use `/project-doc-writer` for that).

## What This Command Does

| This Command (session-handoff) | project-doc-writer Skill |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Captures **session learnings** | Generates docs **from PRD** |
| Updates `.claude/docs/` | Updates `.claude-project/docs/` |
| Run **before context reset** | Run **when PRD changes** |
| Preserves **discoveries & fixes** | Creates **structured documentation** |
